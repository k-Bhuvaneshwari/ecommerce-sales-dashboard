# E-commerce Sales Dashboard
A dynamic sales dashboard built using SQL for data analysis and Excel for visualization to track KPIs like revenue, profit, and trends.
## Project Overview
This project aims to create a dynamic sales dashboard to track the performance of an e-commerce business. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, profit, and sales trends using SQL for data analysis and Excel for data visualization.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For processing and querying sales data.
- **Excel**: For creating the interactive dashboard with pivot tables and visualizations.
- **Power Query**: For dynamic data import and transformation.
  
## KPIs Tracked
1. **Total Revenue** - Sum of all sales over a specific period.
2. **Monthly Sales Trend** - Sales trends over time, displayed by month.
3. **Top Products** - Products that generated the highest revenue.
4. **Sales by Region** - Performance based on geographical region.
5. **Profit Margin** - Difference between revenue and cost.
6. **Average Order Value** - The average value per customer order.

## SQL Queries
The project involves writing complex SQL queries for data analysis, including aggregations (SUM, COUNT), JOINs, and filtering data based on date ranges, regions, and other criteria.

## Data and Dataset
A public e-commerce sales dataset is used to simulate real-world sales data. The dataset includes product information, sales amounts, customer information, and order dates.
